This is just a test post for me to figure out how to use Jekyll.

I am using Jekyll and Github Pages to host my block, instead of going
with Medium. Medium is great if I just want to do long-form writing
where the words speak for themselves, with occasional help from some
static images. This is not enough for me, if I want to write about
code. I need to be able to also include code snippets in my blog
posts. These code snippets need to have proper syntax highlighting and
formating, but provide an easy way for the reader to get a plaintext
copy or fork their own version-controlled copy.

Medium does not let me include Gists in my posts (at least I'm not
aware of a way to do this), but Github Pages does.
